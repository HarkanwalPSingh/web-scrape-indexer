Vishwa Vokkaliga Mahasamastana Math seer Kumara Chandrashekaranatha Swamiji raised the pitch for Shivakumar at the Kempegowda Jayanti event here to commemorate the birth anniversary of Bengaluru's founder, in the presence of both Siddaramaiah and the Deputy Chief Minister on the dais.Shivakumar, who is also the state Congress President, is a Vokkaliga -- a dominant community in the southern parts of the state. Currently, he is the only Deputy Chief Minister. \"Everyone has become Chief Minister and has enjoyed power, but our D K Shivakumar has not become the Chief Minister. So the request is, Siddaramaiah, who has experienced (the post), should please give up the power to our D K Shivakumar in the future, and bless him good,\" Chandrashekaranatha Swamiji said. Addressing the gathering, he said: \"only if Siddaramaiah makes up his mind, this can happen, or else it won't happen. So with 'Namakaras', I request Siddaramaiah to make D K Shivakumar the Chief Minister.\"Reacting to a question on the seer's appeal, Siddaramaiah, later speaking to reporters, said: \"Congress is a high command party....this is a democracy. We will follow whatever the high command says.\" Shivakumar said: \"things have been said.... We both (him and Siddaramaiah) are travelling to New Delhi to discuss with MPs from the state, regarding the state's projects (pending approval from the Centre).\" Later, speaking to reporters in New Delhi, both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar chose to downplay the seer's comments. Siddaramaiah said: \"We are in a democracy...whatever high command decides is final....he (the seer) has said things; he does not know, this is a political party\". Shivakumar added: \"Swamiji has said out of passion, it cannot be taken seriously. In politics, people speak out of admiration, but we will abide by the party's decision.\"\u00a0There was stiff competition between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar for the Chief Minister's post after the declaration of Assembly election results in May last year, and the Congress had managed to convince the latter and made him the Deputy Chief Minister. There were some reports at the time that a compromise had been reached based on a \"rotational chief minister formula,\" according to which Shivakumar will become CM after two-and-half years but they have not been officially confirmed by the party. Shivakumar has made no secret of his ambition to become chief minister, while Siddaramaiah had sought public support during the Lok Sabha polls so that the Congress wins maximum number of seats in the state, which would strengthen his position. A section within the Congress is of the opinion that the statement by the Ministers seeking three more Deputy CMs, was part of a plan by Siddaramaiah\u2019s camp to keep Shivakumar in check, amid talks he might seek the CM post after two-and-half years of this government\u2019s tenure, and to counter his influence both in the government and party.Leaders in Shivakumar's camp too seem to have started coming out openly in support of their leader. Channagiri Congress MLA Basavaraju V Shivaganga on Wednesday urged the party to make Shivakumar the Chief Minister. Some Ministers in the Siddaramaiah cabinet reacted to the seer's comments, with some objecting to it, while others calling it his personal opinion. Co-operation Minister K N Rajanna, who is considered close to Siddaramiah, said: \"who will give up (the position)? Just because he (seer) asked can it be given up? Let the seer give up his position, I will become Swamiji -- ask whether he will give up? No one will give up...I don't know with what intention the seer has said things, in a democracy he has the right to speak.\" Home Minister G Parameshwara said the seer might have shared his personal opinion, but he has nothing to do with the CM post, as the CM is elected following a process involving the political party and its legislators.Agriculture Minister Cheluvarayaswamy, reacting to Swamiji pitching for Shivakumar, said: \"that time may also come, the party and the high command along with MLAs will decide. Swamiji has said his opinion. The party will ultimately decide. Shivakumar is the party President and someone who has commitment towards the party more than anyone else.\" Leader of Opposition in the Assembly R Ashoka said \"this development\" proves that there is divide within the government and it also proves the BJP's claims that this government will not survive for long. \"As far as I know, at a government programme such a humiliation had never happened to a sitting Chief Minister, who heads the government,\" he said, stating that it is better for Siddaramaiah to resign and \"go home.\" Terming the seer's comment as a strategy by Shivakumar to counter Siddaramaiah, Ashoka pointed out that the Chief Minister's camp has been making statements demanding for three more Deputy Chief Ministers.", "timestamp": 1719558660000}

The CID, probing charges against Yediyurappa of sexually assaulting a minor girl, has alleged in the chargesheet that he and three other accused paid money to the alleged victim and her mother to buy their silence. The 81-year-old Yediyurappa has been charged under Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 204 (destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence) and 214 (offering gift or restoration of property in consideration of screening offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The other three co-accused -- Arun Y M, Rudresh M and G Mariswamy who are aides of Yediyurappa -- are charged under IPC Sections 204 and 214, in the chargesheet filed at the Fast Track Court 1 for POCSO Act cases here on Thursday.  On Friday, the HC bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit continued its June 14 order, as it permitted the prosecution to file its objection to the petition filed by Yediyurappa seeking quashing of the case against him. The Special Public Prosecutor sought time to file objections, and maintained that Yediyurappa's petition may not survive as a chargesheet has already been filed. The court then said: \"Call these matters week after next at request of learned Special Public Prosecutor for filing statement of objections if any. Interim order granted earlier to continue till next date of hearing.\" According to the chargesheet, on February 2 this year, at around 11.15 am, the 17-year-old alleged victim, along with her 54-year-old mother -- the complainant -- visited Yediyurappa at his residence in Dollar\u2019s Colony here seeking help in getting justice in a previous case of sexual assault (on the daughter) and other issues. While Yediyurappa was speaking with the mother, he was holding the victim's right wrist with his left hand, it said. Yediyurappa then called the minor inside a meeting room next to the hall and locked the door. He then asked the victim whether she remembered the face of the person who had sexually assaulted her earlier to which the victim replied twice stating that she did, the chargesheet said. After this, Yediyurappa asked her what her age was when she was allegedly sexually assaulted previously, to which she replied six-and-half years, according to the chargesheet. At this point, Yediyurappa allegedly tried to sexually assault her, the CID alleged. The horrified victim pushed Yediyurappa's hand, moved away and asked him to open the door. Yediyurappa then opened the door and exited after putting some cash in the hands of the victim from his pocket. He then told the victim's mother that he couldn\u2019t help them in the case and also gave her some money from his pocket and sent them away, the chargesheet said. After the victim's mother uploaded a video related to the incident on her Facebook account, on February 20, at the behest of Yediyurappa, the other accused -- Arun, Rudresh and Mariswamy -- went to their house and brought them to his residence, it said. According to the chargesheet, Arun then ensured that the victim's mother deleted the video from her Facebook account and her iPhone\u2019s gallery. On Yediyurappa\u2019s directions, Rudresh is said to have paid the alleged victim two lakh in cash. A Bengaluru court on June 13 issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Yediyurappa in the case registered against him on March 14 this year. The Karnataka High Court on June 14 restrained the CID from arresting Yediyurappa, while directing him to appear before it for probe. Yediyurappa was questioned for over three hours by the CID on June 17. The victim's mother, who had leveled the charge against Yediyurappa, died at a private hospital here last month, due to lung cancer. The victim's brother filed a petition in the court earlier this month alleging that though the case was registered on March 14, no progress has been made in the investigation. The petitioner prayed that Yediyurappa should be arrested and interrogated. Yediyurappa has denied the charge and said he would fight the case legally.", "timestamp": 1719657000000}

In Bengaluru alone, 19 out of 49 samples were identified as having synthetic colours present. As a result, officials are advocating for a ban on the use of sauces and sweet chili powder with artificial colours in pani puri preparation across Karnataka, the publication stated.This initiative follows a recent directive from the Karnataka health department mandating the exclusion of artificial colours in various dishes, including all types of kebabs. Earlier in March, the state government had imposed a ban on Rhodamine-B, a commonly used food colouring agent, which had a notable impact on the market for Gobi Manchurian in Bengaluru.
